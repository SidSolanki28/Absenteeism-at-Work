## About Project

Machine Learning Classification model is developed to predict absenteeism at company during work time. This helps in improving decision making by reorganising work process to avoid lack of productivity and increase quality of work.

Integrated Python, SQL, and Tableau which are three of the most widely used tools in the world of data science. Python is the leading programming language; SQL is the most widely used means for communication with database systems; Tableau is the preferred solution for data visualization;

To put it simply â€“ SQL helps us store and manipulate the data we are working with, Python allows us to write code and perform calculations, and then Tableau enables beautiful data visualization. A well-thought-out integration stepping on these three pillars could save a business millions of dollars annually in terms of reporting personnel.
